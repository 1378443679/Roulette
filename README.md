Russian_Roulette

Firstly, i created Gun and Roulette player classes after that i defined their attributes like: GunName, Gun Bullet number, Roulette player name and Player's health.
I decided to make like there is 2 random dice variable and it is given randomly. if firstplayer's dice than secondplayer's dice then firstplayer starts the roulette game otherwise secondplayer starts first to shoot himself/ herself. After that i defined one more random variable for a randomly assigned bullet in 1 to 6. 
like my gun is revolver and revolvers has 6-round magazine then that random bullet is gonna increase one by one until one of the players is lost.
and it is going to tell like player1 is losted and player2 is won.
